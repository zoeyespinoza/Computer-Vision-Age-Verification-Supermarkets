# Computer-Vision-Age-Verification-Supermarkets
Age Verification System for Good Seed Supermarkets, using Computer Vision to implement store policies

## Project Description
Good Seed Supermarkets, a leading grocery chain, is launching a project focused on improving adherence to alcohol sale regulations. The main goal is to prevent the sale of alcohol to underage customers. As a Data Scientist, my role involves assessing and deploying a technological solution to effectively meet this challenge.

## Project Goals
- **Develop a Reliable Model:** Create a model with high accuracy in age estimation to minimize both false positives (wrongly denying a sale to of-age individuals) and false negatives (permitting underage sales).

- **Ensure Legal Compliance:** Align the model's performance with legal age requirements for alcohol sales, thereby upholding Good Seed's commitment to responsible retailing.

- **Enhance Customer Experience:** Implement a system that is non-intrusive and respects customer privacy, while efficiently carrying out age verification.
